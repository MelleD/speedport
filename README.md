Telekom Speedport Integration for Home Assistant based
on [speedport-api](https://github.com/Andre0512/speedport-api.git).

## Introduction

First a few words to start with. A big thank you goes to @Andre0512 (https://github.com/Andre0512/speedport), who initially launched the card, but he does not have enough time for further care. I forked this card for my own HomeAssistant to make a few improvements. I give no guarantee for the functionality and no promise of lifelong maintenance, as I do the whole thing in my free time. Of course, I am happy about every contribution and PR


## Features

- Track presence of connected devices
- Turn on/off wifi (guest/office/normal)
- Reconnect, reboot, wps on
- Sensors (IP-Addresses, Upload/Download, Connection, ...)

## Supported devices

* Speedport Smart 3
* Speedport Smart 4
